**Project:** Interactive Landing Page with Dynamic Navigation Menu

This project was completed as part of my internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**. The goal was to create a responsive landing page with an interactive navigation menu that changes color and style based on user interactions, such as scrolling and hovering.

## Key Features:
- **Responsive Design:** The landing page is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Interactive Navigation Menu:** The navigation menu is fixed at the top of the page, remaining visible as the user scrolls. The background and font color of the menu dynamically change based on user interactions like scrolling and hovering over menu items.
- **HTML Structure:** The page and navigation menu are built using semantic HTML5 elements to ensure a clear, accessible structure.
- **CSS Styling:** Modern CSS techniques were used for styling, including flexbox for layout, transitions for smooth hover effects, and media queries for device compatibility.
- **JavaScript Interactivity:** JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the navigation menu, with color changes triggered by scrolling and hovering.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, Transitions, Media Queries)
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Listeners)

## Learning Outcomes:
- Gained hands-on experience with responsive web design and UI development.
- Enhanced skills in creating dynamic, interactive web elements.
- Practiced implementing JavaScript to manipulate the DOM based on user interactions.
